# Learning with lis.py

This repository contains variations of Peter Norvig's 
[`lis.py` interpreter](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/c33cd6835a506a57d9fe73e3a8317d49babb13e8/py/lis.py)
for a subset of [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)),
described in his post [(How to Write a (Lisp) Interpreter (in Python))](https://norvig.com/lispy.html).
