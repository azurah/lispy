# Norvig's Lispy Calculator

In [(How to Write a (Lisp) Interpreter (in Python))](https://norvig.com/lispy.html),
Peter Norvig describes a small sub-set of the **Scheme** language
that works as a calculator—before he goes on to show `lis.py`,
his interpreter for a signficant subset of **Scheme**.

This is code is derived from the Python 3.10 
[version of `lis.py`](../original/py3.10/),
keeping only the lines needed for the calculator language.
