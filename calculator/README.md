# Norvig's Lispy Calculator

Peter Norvig describes a small subset of the **Scheme** language
that works as a calculator—before he explains `lis.py`
in [(How to Write a (Lisp) Interpreter (in Python))](https://norvig.com/lispy.html).

The [`calc.py`](calc.py) program is derived from the Python 3.10 
[version of `lis.py`](../original/py3.10/),
keeping only the code needed for the calculator language.
