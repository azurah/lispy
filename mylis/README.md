# Changes for Python 3.10

`mylis.py` is a variation of the Python 3.10
[version](../original/py3.10/) of `lis.py`,
adding some features for demonstration.


## Command-line integration

You can run programs written in the supported Scheme subset from the
command-line, like this:

```
$ ./mylis.py examples/newton.scm x=12345654321
111111.0
```

The `x=12345654321` option creates an `x` global variable with the given value.

If you read [examples/newton.scm](examples/newton.scm) you'see that the last line is:

```scheme
(display (sqrt x))
```

The `x` is not defined in the program,
so it must be given as a command-line argument: `x=...`.

Any command-line option with the syntax `<symbol>=<value>`
will be interpreted as a global `(define x value)`
with the limitation that `value` must be an integer, a float or a symbol.

If you forget to provide a required argument,
the interpreter will make a suggestion (but currently it stops at the first issue found):

```
$ ./mylis.py examples/newton.scm
ðŸš¨  Undefined 'x'. You can provide it as an option:
    $ mylis.py examples/newton.scm x=<value>
```
